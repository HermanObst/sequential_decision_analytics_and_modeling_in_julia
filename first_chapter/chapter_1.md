**Chapter 1: Modeling Sequential Decision Problems**

Sequential decision problems are the ones we can write as:
*decision, information, decision, information, decision,...*

And every time we make a decision we incur a cost or receive a contribution or reward.

**How to model a sequential decision problem**

we can model any sequential decision problem using the sequence:

(S0,x0,W1,S1,x1,W2,...,St,xt,Wt+1,...,ST)

- St is the state variables (the state of our knowledge)
- xt represent decision variables 
- Wt+1 is the information that arrives after we make the decision xt
